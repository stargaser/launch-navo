# workshop-env

The purpose of this repository is to provide environment information to mybinder.org
for building Docker images to launch for workshops. The workshop content is
pulled into the Docker image at runtime. This setup avoids the overhead and
wait time of building a new Docker image when content changes are made.

that the Binder session will time out after ten minutes of inactivity.
